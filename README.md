# Overview

This React program takes a users input for items in a grocery list and generates a list with the ability to check off each item and also delete checked off items from the list.

This program was used as my own introduction to React. I learned a lot about the structure and nuances of this language through following and editing this program.

With this program I explored React's components, class, events, lists, and forms.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to create and edit this program, I found it very useful for React-specific problem solving.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
